            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Bill Gates is an American businessman, inventor, and philanthropist. He is one of the co-founders of the Microsoft Corporation, the American computer conglomerate that is responsible for some of the most impactful innovations in the history and creation of modern computing and the internet, including products like Microsoft Windows, Office, and Internet Explorer. Microsoft
                  Gates’s entire business career has involved Microsoft in some way. The company was co-founded with Steve Ballimer in 1975 when Gates and Ballimer contracted with Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems to develop a BASIC emulator for the MITS. Gates and Ballimer programmed the first emulator, but as the company grew, he became the company’s Chief Executive Officer. Despite this, Gates remained intimately involved in the computing programming of the company, programing games as late as 1981.
                  
                  
                  Microsoft and Gates would next move into the creation of operating systems with IBM, working with the company to program and license 86-DOS, the main operating system for that program. This, eventually, would evolve into Microsoft’s greatest commercial success: The development of Windows, a brand new, graphically-based operating system. The first version of Windows was released in 1985, and the operating system has now become an industry standard and the most popular of computer operating systems. 
                  
                  Microsoft’s success propelled Gates into wealth beyond his wildest dreams. At the age of 31, he was a billionaire. 
                  
                  Microsoft would get intimately involved in a variety of other programs, including business programming, internet use, word processing, computer games, entertainment, and more. 
                  
                  Gates would step down as CEO of the company in 2000, paving the way for Steve Ballimer to run the company. However, he has remained actively involved with the company, stepping down from its board in March of 2020 to continue to focus on his philanthropy. Marriage
                  Gates married his now ex-wife, Melinda French, in 1994. The two met while they were working together at Microsoft. 
                  
                  Children
                  Like his father, Bill Gates has three children in his family. All three come from his marriage to Melinda: Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe. Bill and Melinda have both discussed their attempts to ensure that their daughters and son have the most “normal” upbringing possible, which included limiting their screen time when they were kids. 
                  
                  Divorce
                  In May 2021, Bill and Melinda Gates took to Twitter and announced that they would be looking to divorce. The Twitter announcement took the world by surprise, but later reports indicate that one of the sources of tension in their marriage was Bill Gates’ relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the American businessman who was arrested and convicted of multiple sex crimes. According to reports, Melinda Gates began speaking with divorce attorneys as early as 2019, with Gates’ relationship with Epstein serving to spur the end of their relationship. The exact nature of Bill Gates’ relationship with Epstein has been speculated on repeatedly both before and after the divorce.The Turing Award is given to computer engineers, innovators, and inventors who have “shaped the foundations” of computing. It is named after Alan Turing, the famed mathematician and computer scientist. 


Presidential Medal of Freedom
The Presidential Medal of Freedom is one of the highest civilian honors an individual can win, given to individuals by the President of the United States in recognition of major contributions to the United States. Gates won the award in 2016 and was awarded it by then-President Barack Obama.

Padma Bhushan Award
The Padma Bhushan Award is given by the Indian government to individuals who have made major contributions to India. Bill and Melinda Gates were given this award in 2015 in recognition of their philanthropic work.
